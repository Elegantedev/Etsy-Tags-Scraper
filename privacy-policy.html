    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p>
        EtsyXtractor ("the extension") operates as a browser extension that helps users scrape tags and related searches from Etsy listings. This privacy policy outlines how the extension handles user data.
    </p>
    <h2>Information Collection and Use</h2>
    <p>
        The extension does not collect, store, or share any personally identifiable information. All data scraped by the extension is stored locally on the user's device and is not transmitted to any external servers.
    </p>
    <h2>Permissions</h2>
    <p>
        The extension requests the following permissions:
        <ul>
            <li>activeTab: To interact with the current tab and scrape tag information from Etsy listings.</li>
            <li>storage: To save scraped tags and related searches locally on the user's device.</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <h2>Data Security</h2>
    <p>
        Since the extension does not transmit any data over the internet, user data remains secure on the user's device. Users are responsible for managing their own data privacy and security.
    </p>
    <h2>Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>
        This privacy policy may be updated from time to time. Users are advised to review this policy periodically for any changes.
